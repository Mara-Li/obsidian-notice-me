# Notice Me (Senpai!)

A plugin that allows you to create notice at fixed interval. It is useful for reminding to do something, like taking a break, or drinking water.

There is only three settings per notice:
- The interval between each notice
- The duration of the notice
- The content of the notice

To add a new notice, just click the `+` button in the plugin's settings.
